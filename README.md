Description:

This is a personal web development project that I initiated as a member of a small editing community. It served as my inaugural venture into PHP, MySQL, and HTML/CSS web development.

Project Overview:

CommunityHub was designed to create a cohesive community of like-minded individuals. Its core purpose was to showcase various talents that could be leveraged for business opportunities. We offered services such as video editing for musicians and provided a platform for graphic design and animation enthusiasts.

This all-in-one website catered to both PC and MAC users, offering a comprehensive repository of editing resources. With over 1000 monthly users, CommunityHub grew into a thriving community.

I personally managed and regularly updated the website to ensure its smooth operation.

This project highlights my ability to initiate and develop web-based solutions, as well as my commitment to maintaining and improving them over time.
